# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This study guide was created for students who will be taking part in the upcoming bootcamp to be able to store information from their prework study guide. This project was built to begin to understand the workings of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how these languages can talk to each other to build structure, provide style and alow the user to interact with the webpage. This will also be an interesting piece of work to look back on when done with the bootcamp to see how much has been learnt. This project solves the issue of students not having a resource to store their study guide materials and this provides them that resource. What did you learn? This project taught me how to build a webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and linking these with each other.
